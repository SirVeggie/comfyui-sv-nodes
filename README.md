## Custom nodes for ComfyUI

Currently includes simple nodes that I wanted for easier and more compact workflow creation, and flow control nodes.

### Documentation

See the [wiki](https://github.com/SirVeggie/comfyui-sv-nodes/wiki).

## Node list

This list is very, very out of date. :)

- String Separator: split text into two parts (useful for positive and negative prompt)
- Check None: true if input was None, useful for flow control
